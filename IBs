===============
Financial Terms
===============

1. Liquidity

What bank will do if all its customer come in one go and ask to return money ??? 
================================================================================
They should have cash or asset equivalent of that to return immediately. 
So the cash which will get us cash is Liquid cash. 

Ex. Cash/Gold - Liquid asset
    Land      - Not Liquid asset. //bcoz it can't be sold immediately to get cash.

Order: Cash>Gold>Land 

Liquidity ==> So every bank has to maintain liquidity(maintaining Liquid asset) which can give money 

immediately.

NOTE:
-----
Statutory Liquidity Ratio(SLR) is by definition the amount of highly liquid assets that a commercial bank must 

keep to meet its day-to-day demand and time deposit liabilities.




2. Equity & Debt.

How to Corporate Finance/Expand business/Raising capital for new Projects in company
====================================================================================

Through : Equity & Debt ==> 

Equity --> Raising Capital by - Selling stocks/shares. - NO RePaid   
//Share portion of your company to raise money. 


Debt --> Raising Capital by - Borrowing  ex. Loan, Bonds - YES RePaid  



3. Underwriting

What if firm open IPO to sell its shares and unable to manage sell all of its shares.
====================================================================================
Who will manage such situations?

--> Here comes underwriters.

An Underwriter is simply an entity(can be a person or company)which assits as well as gurantees a company to 

sell a particular number of issued shares and charges an already fixed commission for it.Suppose he gurantees 

to sell 1000 shares and he is only able to sell 800. The underwiter will have to buy the remaining 200.


******//Here comes the 'underwriters'. They guarantee Company A the share Capital they want to raise by 

committing to sell the number of shares which remain unsubscribed. For this they charge a percentage of the 

raised Capital as their fees.


NOTE: One firm has to sell minimum of IPOs. Threshold set by SEBI(Securities Exchange Board of India) i.e 

Minimum subscription should be 90%. Else allotement will note be possible. They have to take this back.
Underwriters helps. They guarantee that All shares are sold. If less are sold then they will buy to sell them 

all.

What Risks?

The IPO price of the stock was fixed at around Rs.328, but the underwriters will buy a significant portion of 

the issuing shares at a discount at say Rs.230 per share. 

NOTE: What if shares bought by investement bank never goes up, then they add markup and sale them at high 

price, so that generated profit compensates for the risk they took on.

Who were the under writers?

Kotak Mahindra Bank
Morgan Stanley
Citigroup
Others


Why so many under writers?

This is because the risks are shared among them and they operate in a syndicate to manage the issue well. Also, 

it is in the interest of the issuing company to go with many underwriters to avoid any manipulations.




4. Private Placements.         //To avoid underwriting to raise capital....

What if firm doens't want to raise capital throgh IPOs/shares.???
=================================================================
Place an offering of bonds with institutional investor like insurance company or retirement fund and get 

capital raised.

NOTE: This is faster way to raise capital. //Bcoz no need to register this sort of offering with the SEC.

NOTE: The government considers institutional investors to be more sophisticated than individual investors, so 

there are fewer regulations for private placements.
