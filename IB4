  //This allows hedge fund's Collateral to be placed in the CUSTODIAN.  #CollateralWithCUSTODIAN
  //The Collateral is available to cover the losses of the hedge fund, in case prime broker is of suspect.



  Hedge Fund    <----------->  
                   
                               CASH and SECURITIES   //Collateral //Custodian

  DEALER BANK   <----------->
 (Prime Broker)

History
=======

The basic services offered by a prime broker give a money manager the ability to trade with multiple brokerage houses while maintaining, in a centralized master account at their prime broker, all of the hedge fundâ€™s cash and securities. Additionally, the prime broker offers stock loan services, portfolio reporting, consolidated cash management and other services. Fundamentally, the advent of the prime broker freed the money manager from the more time consuming and expensive aspects of running a fund. These services worked because they also allowed the money manager to maintain relationships with multiple brokerage houses for IPO allocations, research, best execution, conference access and other products.
