Description :  This application finds acts like engine to find eligibility of the collateral provider. If any customer/client wants to borrow money from our firm, then he may have to lend his securities as his collateral. TO find if he is eligible for financial help we run his securities through CES app and decide whether to give him financial help or not.

Rules for collateral eligibility are already defined in CES app. Once clients comes we just check his eligibility to get loan after we process his securities as collateral.

This project is being developed as a Web Application using Angular-2, TypScript, RxJS, GulpJS, Npm, NodeJS.  It is de-signed in such a way that a single command could compile entire JS Code, do Static code analysis (JSHint, CSSLint with reports), Combine module specific JS and CSS files into a single minified JS and CSS file, finally generates ready to de-ploy builds for any given environment (DEV and Production). Also it runs a Jest and Enzyme driven unit test cases on the code with all final reports and screenshots of failed test cases. This framework is made to be used by a developer, tester and release teams with individual mode of usage.

This project has both RestAPI and Client deployed on JPMC’s Private AWS clound separately. Client(UI) is running as a NodeJS application and RestAPI(Java Springs) server is running as a Java application. UI Client is connecting to RestAPIs using Client secret IDs shared by server.
