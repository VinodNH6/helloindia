=========================================
Commercial Banking vs Investement Banking - Best Example.
=========================================
Trying to explain in simple transactional way:

Your close friend A has $1 Million excess cash lying idle for investment

You have another friend B (not known to A) who identifies a nice real estate investment, but is short of say $250K.

You tell A that a friend of yours (B) has a nice real estate investment oppportunity and requires $250K funding. A has two options to go for:

1. Fund B’s investment with $250K with proportionate shareholding in the real estate investment. If the price of property goes up, A benefits to the extent of shareholding. But if the price if property goes down, A bears losses proportionate to the shareholding. You earn some commision to fix the deal. Maybe you decide the real estate investment is too lucrative and put your own $50K as well.


2. B does not want to give away any shareholding. He would rather prefer to return the money back in another 5 years in 60 monthly installments at 5%interest. He asks you to stand as guarantee and in turn offers you 2% additional day interest over the 5 year period. A trusts you as a guarator of okays to extend the loan.

Case 1 you are an investment banker & case 2 you are a commercial banker.

If you assist an entity to invest wherein returns are dependent on profits , it is more or less investment banking. In case you assist an entity to get assured returns over a fixed tenor, its more likely to be commercial banking.

Investment banking deals with investing people’s money wherein theres no assured return, but chances exist for high profit returns. It deals with high value money at stake , higher risks, higher returns. Hence more exciting and high pressure job.

Commercial banking is a bit simpler, you lend to entities with assured repayment capabilities. Returns on investment are small. You dont tend to do fancy financial stuff and its a conservative way of doing finance.






=====================
Collateral Management
=====================

Collateral is property/asset that you give to bank to secure loan if i fail to pay the full loan amount.

Ex. If you get mortgage, HOUSE - is COllateral.

IF you stop making your monthly house payments, the bank/lender can take possession of the home through a process called foreclosure and sell it back the principal it lent you.

Ex. In Margin trading,  securities in your account act as a collateral.

Ex. If auto loan, AUTO - is Collateral.

Ex. If credit card money, then there is no collateral. So credit card debt carries a significantly higher interest rate than mortgage debt or auto loan debt.

Collateral Loan ==> It always less interest rate.


The most common types of collateral are: 
- real estate, 
- equipment, 
- vehicles, 
- financial assets such as stocks or annuities or CD’s.




=====================
Financial Derivatives
=====================

What if you sell goods today and expects payment after 1month. What is value of money changes in between?? 
==========================================================================================================

Buyer will make an arrangement. where he fixes the exchange rate today itself. 
//Such arrangement happens through financial derivatives.


Problem: 
--------
Let us consider a scenario where an exporter exports his goods today and expects payment after 1 month in USD.Once he receives the payment, he will go to bank and will convert it to INR.But, he is afraid that exchange rate may not be same after 1 month. 

Solution: - [Derivates]
---------
He will make an arrangement wherein he fixes the exchange rate today itself.Such arrangements are entered through financial derivatives.


What are Derivates?
-------------------
Financial derivatives are instruments which helps to minimize the risk by fixing the price today and its value is linked to assets such as gold,crude oil,equities,currencies, commodities.



Risk:: What if after 1month value decreases havily???? 
------------------------------------------------
Then one has to sell all its underlying assets to pay... Thats why derivates are also called as a "Weapon of mass distraction."

NOTE: 2008 financial crisis is often attributed to credit derivatives.


Common forms of Derivatives:: 

1. Forwards
2. Futures
3. Options
4. Swaps
5. Alos exotics like, Swaptions /LEAPs,/ CMOs...

Why Derivatives??
-----------------
Derivatives enable the avoidance of unnecessary risks.

Hedge Fund vs Mutual Fund
=========================

                //No lock-up period.
                //only stocks(equity) or bonds(debt).
                //Don't use Leverage.
                //Is managed portfolio.**                 


Hedge Fund --> A person with big cash(Have to meet certain criteria) to invest in this.  //Bcoz these ppl have less SEC regulations.
               //Lock-up period on investors..
               //Trade everything.. Stocks/Derivatives/life insurance policies/wine/art.
               //Use leverage..
               //Is managed portfolio.**

Mutual fund company - is in business of making investements.


Super - Why mutual fund than direct investmenet?
------------------------------------------------
**********************
If i invest directly into Google's stock and what if google performs bad in next quarter. Then i will loose all money.

But if i buy shares of mutual fund(who owns small part of google's stock, small part of Apple's stock...). and Google performs bad in next quarter, Then i will loose only fraction of amount bcoz google  is just a small part of the fund's portfolio.
